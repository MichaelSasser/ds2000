ds2000's documentation!
=======================

The `RIGOL DS2000(A)` Series is a fairly cheap, sub $600, entry-level
oscilloscope family with many bells and whistles. This Python package uses
the `LXI` capabilities of the scope to make it remote controllable from
within Python without ever needing to touch any `SCPI` command. You will be able
to use any function of your oscilloscope with a python interface. It wraps
every command and puts it in a logical high-level interface for you.
