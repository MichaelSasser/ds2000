        :CHANnel<n>:SCALe

        Syntax
        :CHANnel<n>:SCALe <scale>
        :CHANnel<n>:SCALe?

        Description
        Set the vertical scale of the waveform of CH1 or CH2.
        Query the current vertical scale of the waveform of CH1 or CH2.

        Parameter
        | Name     | Type     | Range         | Default |
        |----------+----------+---------------+---------|
        | <n>      | Discrete | {1|2}         | --      |
        | <scale>  | Real     | 500Î¼V to 10V  | 1V      |
        Note: the range of the vertical scale is related to the probe ratio currently set. For the setting of the probe ratio, refer to the :CHANnel<n>:PROBe command.

        Return Format
        The query returns the vertical scale in scientific notation.

        Example
        :CHANnel1:SCALe 1
        The query returns 1.000000e+00.
