        Returned Format:
        The query returns MAIN or DELAYED.

        :TIM:MODE MAIN Setup the horizontal timebase as MAIN.

        In NORMAL mode, the range of <scale_val> is 1s ~ end of the memory;

        In SCAN mode, the range of <scale_val> is -6*Scale ~ +6*Scale; (Note: Scale indicates the current horizontal scale, the unit is s/div.)
        In MAIN state, the item [:DELayed] should be omitted.
        Returned Format:
        The query returns the setting value of the <offset> in s.
        Example:
        :TIM:MODE MAIN Setup the scan mode of horizontal timebase as MAIN.

        Syntax
        :TIMebase[:MAIN]:SCALe <scale_value>

        Description
        Set the scale of the main time base and the unit is s/div.
        Query the current scale of the main time base.

        Name            Type    Range                   Default
        <scale_value>   Real    Depend on the time      1Î¼s

                                ROLL:   200ms to 1ks

        Note[1]: refer to the :TIMebase:MODE command.
        Note[2]: this value is different for different model. For DS2072 and
                 DS2012, the value is 5 ns.

        Return Format
        The query returns the current scale of the main time base in scientific notation.

        Example
        :TIMebase:MAIN:SCALe 0.0002
        The query returns 2.000000e-04.
